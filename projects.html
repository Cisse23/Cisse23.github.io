        <br />
        <p>
            For our last school project we made a 3D Skeet Shooter game in Unity. 
            I did most of the programming for this game, including gameplay mechanics, 
            programming the UI and designing and implementing a simple SQLite database 
            to store scores and show rankings in the game.

        <h2>Testing the database</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to practice planning tests and writing test cases and a test report, so I planned a simple test for the database. <br />
            I found writing the Test Plan was the most difficult, it was really hard to decide what should be included.
            I looked at different Test Plans that I found online, and based my plan on those.<br />
            To plan test cases I used our design documentation. I found a great Test Summary Report template on <a href="https://www.guru99.com/" target=" _blank">Guru99.com</a>.

                <p>This is a simple quiz I made as apersonal project. The motivation was to learn geography while learning to code!</p>
                <p>The player types in as many States as they can remember into the Input Field. The States that they have remembered
                will turn green on the map. By clicking "Give Up" the player can end the round and see the States that they couldn't remember.</p>

                <br />
                <p>
                    I needed a portfolio and I wanted to try making a responsive layout using CSS-grids.
                    -> I watched some tutorials and then I made this site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started by roughly outlining what I needed with a pen and paper before moving to plan the UI in Figma.
                    When I was happy with the design, I started coding it in Visual Studio.
                </p>
                <img src="figma-sivuja.PNG" />
                <p>
                    While testing the site, I realized that I was relying very heavily on hover effects to provide visual feedback
                    when the user clicks a link on my page. This doesn’t work well on mobile, and I’ll need to do some research on
                    the subject to find a better solution for my portfolio. But until then, I’m pretty happy with the result!
