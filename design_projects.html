                <p>
                    I needed a portfolio and I wanted to try making a responsive layout using CSS-grids.
                    -> I watched some tutorials and then I made this site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started by roughly outlining what I needed with a pen and paper before moving to plan the UI in
                    Figma.
                    When I was happy with the design, I started coding it in Visual Studio.
                </p>

                <p>This is what the first version of this site looked like <br>

                </p>

                <p>
                    While testing the site, I realized that I was relying very heavily on hover effects to provide
                    visual feedback
                    when the user clicks a link on my page. This doesn’t work well on mobile, and I’ll need to do some
                    research on
                    the subject to find a better solution for my portfolio. But until then, I’m pretty happy with the
                    result!

                <h1>Video Editing project</h1>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I was asked to edit this video by cutting excess material, adding text, still images and background
                    music.
                    I started planning by laying out all the materials in padlet. When I had an idea of what I needed, I
                    started learning how to do
                    transitions and add text in ShotCut.

                </p>
                <img src="EFNUpadlet.PNG" />
                <p>
                    I wanted to add some motion to the still images. The first image was an airplane with loads of empty
                    space around it, so it was very
                    simple to just zoom in on the picture. For the second picture the same trick didn't work, so I
                    decided to make the clouds move. I found a
                    free video of clouds, that I could play behind the image. I removed the sky from the original image
                    and used Color Grading to get the color
                    of sky in the video closer to the original sky of the picture.

                    I used to design calendars for Ajasto. Here are some of the products that I designed while I worked
